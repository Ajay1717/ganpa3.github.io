[GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2021 results have been announced. And I am selected. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I will be working with Zulip this summer! You can see my project details at https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4844794074890240.

I have been anxiously waiting for this moment for more than a month now since submitting my proposal in March.

It all started in October when I started looking for open-source organizations to contribute to. It was at that time I found Zulip. I never looked back.
These past 4 months contributing to Zulip have been amazing and I learned a lot. Large codebases don't fear me anymore :)

See you after this community bonding period ends.

Cheers!
